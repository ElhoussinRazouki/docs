# Minimal GitHub Pages site

This folder contains a minimal static site you can publish with GitHub Pages.

Quick start

1. Commit and push this `docs/` folder to your repository (example uses `main`):

```bash
git add docs
git commit -m "Add initial GitHub Pages site"
git push origin main
```

2. In your repository settings on GitHub, under "Pages", set the source to the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch (or use `gh-pages` branch if you prefer).

3. Optionally add a `CNAME` file in this folder to use a custom domain.

.nojekyll

This repository includes a `.nojekyll` file to prevent GitHub Pages from ignoring files that start with an underscore.
